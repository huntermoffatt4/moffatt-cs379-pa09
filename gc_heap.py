PA 9: The Garbage Collector -- starter.

Complete GCHeap below. See the assignment, Part B,
for the full requirements.

Use gc_heap.py as specified in the assignment and imported by the harness.

Design note: GCHeap.allocate(obj) takes exactly one argument per the
spec, so an allocated object that references OTHER heap handles must
expose them itself for decref's cascade to find -- via a
get_child_handles() -> list[int] method. HeapNode below is a given
example object shaped this way, used by the cyclic-structure test.
